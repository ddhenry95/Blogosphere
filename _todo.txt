Blogosphere: TO DO

---------
OBJ:    Create a website with a text box
        that allows someone to input text
        that will be submitted and displayed.
        Nothing fancy, just make a button that
        does stuff. The CSS can be applied
        later.

Components:

HEADER

BUTTON:         When clicked, it should open
                a text box where the user can
                type what they want, with a
                button at the bottom to let them
                send it.

TEXT BOX        The text box should be a bit
                bigger, more like something you
                would see in Reddit or something.
